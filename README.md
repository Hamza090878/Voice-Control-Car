# Voice-Control-Car
Port A:
 I have used pins PA2,PA3,PA4,PA6 of Port A giving them logic 1 motors will work in forward and reverse direction.
 The logic 1 given to pin PA3 & PA4 sets motors to operate in forward direction.While, setting logic 1 to pin PA2 & PA6 sets them to operate in reverse direction.
Port E:
 I have used pins PE4,PE5 as Rx and Tx(reciving and transmitting pins for UART module 5) which receives voice commands from HC-05(bluetooth module).
Port F:
 I have used pins PF1,PF2,PF3 to turn on LEDs(red, blue and green).
